# Practice--media-query
This project is not complex because i'm still in the learning curve. 
The project consist of HTML, CSS and Media Query.
HTML is for the writeups of the project,
CSS is for the design, colors, and sizes of the project especially on PC and
Media query is for the responsiveness of the project, to make the project view on mobile look good.
Thank you!!
